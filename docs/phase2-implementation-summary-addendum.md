# MSA Payroll System - Phase 2 Implementation Update (June 2025)

## Database Schema Enhancements

We have updated the database schema to better align with the client requirements:

1. **Employee Table Updates**:
   - Added `hourly_rate` field for more accurate bi-weekly pay calculations
   - Added `is_exempt_ss` and `is_exempt_medical` flags to handle specific employee exemptions
   - Added `email` field to the main employee table for better integration

2. **Payroll Items Updates**:
   - Added `total_employer_contributions` field to explicitly track employer contributions
   - This provides better reporting capabilities and clear separation between employee deductions and employer costs

## Calculation Logic Improvements

We've made several improvements to the payroll calculation logic:

1. **Gross Pay Calculation**:
   - For bi-weekly payments, now uses the employee's hourly rate directly, falling back to salary-based calculations only if hourly rate isn't specified
   - This provides more accurate pay calculations based on actual hours worked

2. **Employer Contribution Handling**:
   - Employer contributions are now properly calculated and returned as a separate total
   - The system correctly handles employer portions of Social Security (9%) and Medical Benefits (3.5% for employees under 60, 0% for senior employees)

3. **Exemption Handling**:
   - Updated field names for exemptions to match database schema (`is_exempt_ss` and `is_exempt_medical`)
   - Improved validation to ensure these fields are properly processed

## Implementation Details

The updates required changes to several core files:

1. **Database Migrations**:
   - Added migration 010 to update the employees table
   - Added migration 011 to update the payroll_items table

2. **Models**:
   - Updated Payroll.js to use the new fields and calculation logic
   - Added total employer contribution calculation

3. **Controllers**:
   - Updated employeeController.js to handle the new fields

4. **Validation**:
   - Added validation rules for the new fields in validator.js

## Impact on Client Requirements

These updates ensure the system now properly addresses all the client requirements:

1. **Payroll Calculations** ✓
   - Correctly implements all specified deduction rules
   - Properly handles both employee deductions and employer contributions
   - Calculates prorated caps for bi-weekly payments

2. **Employee Management** ✓
   - Added all required fields including exemption overrides
   - Improved email handling in the database

3. **Work Hour Calculation** ✓
   - No changes needed, the existing implementation correctly converts time entries to hours

4. **Outputs** ✓
   - Enhanced database records with employer contribution totals
   - Improved reporting capabilities

## Usage Instructions

To implement these changes:

1. Run the new migrations:
   ```
   ./migrations/migrate.sh
   ```

2. Update existing employee records with hourly rates for accurate bi-weekly calculations

3. Use the updated API endpoints to create and manage employees with the new fields
